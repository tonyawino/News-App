# Popular News

Popular News is an Android application consuming the [NY Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) 
to display most popular news over the last 7 days. The app follows clean architecture principles 
and uses MVVM with the Android architecture components.

## Demo

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![List to detail mobile](./screenshots/mobile_list_to_detail.gif "List to detail mobile")  |  ![List to detail tablet](./screenshots/tablet_list_to_detail.gif "List to detail tablet")
![Search mobile](./screenshots/mobile_search.gif "Search mobile")  |  ![Search tablet](./screenshots/tablet_search.gif "Search tablet")
![Sort mobile](./screenshots/mobile_sort.gif "Sort mobile")  |  ![Sort tablet](./screenshots/tablet_sort.gif "Sort tablet")


## Project Setup

1. Clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/tonyawino/News-App.git```
1. Open the project in Android Studio
1. Generate a [NY Times API Key](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) 
1. Add the API Key to your local `gradle.properties` file with the key `NY_TIMES_API_KEY` 
    and the value of your API Key e.g `NY_TIMES_API_KEY="cjCe8546151551894561s"`
1. Sync and build your project.
1. Hit "Run". Done!
## Architecture Overview

The application has three layers guided by clean architecture to provide clear 
separation of concerns:

![Three layer architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-domain-overview.png)

### UI

The `ui` package has files that make up the interface i.e. activities and fragments. 
ViewModels are also contained in this package and they are used to handle the states 
of the views, which is exposed using LiveData. Additionally, the ViewModels also 
act as an interface of communicating with the other layers.

### Domain

The `domain` package has the domain models/entities that represent data to be handled 
across the whole app i.e. from the UI to the data layer. The layer also contains 
use cases that represent various actions that can be performed for data transfer 
between the data and UI layers. A repository interface is also in the domain layer, 
and it defines a contract to be followed by any repository implementation. 

### Data

The `data` layer is divided into two data sources, local and remote. The two data 
sources collaborate to have a single source of truth, which is the local layer. 
The remote source is in the `retrofit` package and is used to communicate with the 
remote server, while the local source is in the `room` package. The repository maps 
data from these two sources into the required domain models.

#### Helpers

Packages used to tie the whole setup together include `di` for dependency injection 
and `utils` which contains some shared utilities.
## Testing

Most packages, and files, have their own tests, with exceptions such as the dependency 
injection files.  

Server responses are mocked and verified for correctness. The local 
database is tested using an in-memory database that is faster than an actual database 
and only lasts the duraction of the test.  

Use cases are also tested for correctness and validation of data.

ViewModels were also tested for correctness using the UseCases and the repository with 
a mock webserver and an in-momory database.

The instrumentation tests use a mocked context and a mocked server. This is to test 
various scenarios including the unavailability of internet. 

### Running the tests

The application contains unit tests that run on the local machine and instrumented tests that 
require the use of an emulator or connected Android device. 

1. Run the task `./gradlew connectedCheck` to run both local unit tests and instrumented tests
1. Run the task `./gradlew test` for local unit tests
1. Locate the test coverage results at `/app/build/reports/coverage/androidTest/debug`
1. Locate the local unit test results at
    - HTML test result files at `/app/build/reports/tests/`
    - XML test result files at `/app/build/test-results/`
1. Locate the instrumented test results at
    - HTML test result files at `/app/build/reports/androidTests/connected/`
    - XML test result files at `/app/build/outputs/androidTest-results/connected/`
## Libraries

 
Libraries used in the whole application are:

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€
